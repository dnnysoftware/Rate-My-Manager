<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Rate My Manager MERN Stack Project

![My Demo](img/demo.png)
![State Captial GPS Search](img/Captials-Map.png)

This project is a web application designed to have users search for paths between state capitals using several search algorithm types such as A* Search, BFS and DFS (arranged from most efficient/least cost to the least efficient/most cost in regards to how many miles it takes to travel from a start to end position). Each city node is highlighted on the map and when the search algorithm takes place the path using a specific search algorithm is shown highlighted in green.

At Runtime: 
* Docker runs both web server containers (react and springboot).
* Person uses the drop-down menus to choose a start city, end city and search algorithm type.
* Springboot web server returns a description of the path and how many miles it took as well as an ordered list of CityNodes which contain latitude and longitude information to be displayed.
* React web server updates component and displays the path and highlights the CityNodes on that path.
